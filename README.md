### Hi there üëã, I'm Daniel

#### üöÄ Backend Developer | Java, Spring Boot & AI-Ready

I'm passionate about building scalable backend solutions and continuously evolving my skill set to stay at the forefront of technology. My journey has led me from robust Java microservices to exploring the powerful intersection between **Spring Boot** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I thrive on learning and sharing knowledge, with a hands-on approach to real-world challenges.

**Current Focus (2024):**  
- üîé **Modern Java & Spring Boot:** Native Images with GraalVM, Virtual Threads (Project Loom), advanced Observability, and robust Testing (Testcontainers, WireMock).
- ü§ñ **Artificial Intelligence Integration:** Connecting APIs with LLMs (OpenAI, Cohere), working with embeddings, prompt engineering, and vector databases (ChromaDB, pgvector).
- üèóÔ∏è **Microservices & Event-Driven Architecture:** Building resilient, scalable systems with Spring Cloud, Kafka, and modern cloud patterns.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Best Practices:** OAuth2/JWT, input validation, and prompt injection defense.

**Learning Roadmap:**  
I'm following a structured roadmap to become an **AI-Ready Spring Developer** and an expert in integrating modern AI into production backend systems:

- **Spring Boot 3.x Advanced:** GraalVM, Project Loom, advanced tracing/observability, modern testing practices.
- **LLMs & Embeddings:** Basics of generative AI for developers, prompt engineering, API integration.
- **Spring AI & Vector DBs:** Practical integration of Spring AI clients, error handling, security, ChromaDB and pgvector.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Semantic search and knowledge retrieval with Java.
- **Enterprise Patterns:** Event sourcing, microservices security, scalable deployments (Docker/Kubernetes), real-time observability.

**Skills & Technologies**
- **Languages:** Java 21, Python (learning)
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot 3.x, Spring AI
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB, pgvector
- **Messaging/Event Streaming:** Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes (learning), Git, CI/CD, Observability (Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, Grafana)
- **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, RAG (AI)
- **Testing:** Testcontainers, WireMock

**Projects & Portfolio**
- Building and sharing real projects with:  
  - Modern Java & Spring Boot APIs  
  - LLM integration in production  
  - Vector-based search with AI  
  - Event-driven microservices

**Goals for 2024**
- ‚úÖ Deliver a production-ready MVP with Spring Boot + AI
- ‚úÖ Publish hands-on guides and examples for the community
- ‚úÖ Grow as a technical leader in scalable backend & AI-powered solutions
